Project Title -  Ambusmart


Description * -

 Ambusmart ➜  traffic detection / GPS /GSM / LORA inbuilt / well equipped    
thermal imaging / heat signature detection /  Android and IOS apps .


Nature of Problem *



Individual -
Society    -  ✔️
Global      -  ✔️



Three Reason why you choose the problem to solve *

 
 1. The conditions of ambulances is hilarious  , nearly 20% of the patients dies in ambulance due to traffic jams.


 2. People need to wait a lot for the ambulance they are unable to know the current location of the ambulance and that’s why many patients develops critical conditions and even dies still waiting for the ambulance only.


 3. Many of the ambulance don’t have accurate pre medical treatment for the patient. 




Motivation Behind solving problem * 



⇒ people faces a lot of problems when ambulance noy reaches on time . 
and it also can put the life the patient on risk when it stuck in a traffic jam.




Proposed Solution *



⇒ a smart ambulance which is directly connected with the traffic system using LORA technology

and can detect the nature of the traffic using GPS and GSM and with this only it can be directly 

notifiedabout any accident (from where it has to take the patient ) . connected with the victims

using real time tracking and google mapping  , for [re medical treatment it comes with an app in 

both android and IOS for patients. It detects any type of hindrance in its way 

( accidents , rallies , strikes , gatherings , social tensions ) using thermal imaging.



Future Prospect ( Minimal Viable duct / Commercial * 


⇒ Easy traffic manipulation by LORA technology.

⇒ crowd detection on its way using thermal imaging.

⇒ Equipments for pre medical treatment.



SURVEY REPORT ➗


∎ Every second heart attack patient in India takes more than 400 minutes to reach a hospital, which is almost 13 times more than the

ideal window of 30 minutes, government data shows.


∎ A two-year data from the ongoing Management of Acute Coronary Event (MACE) Registry of the Indian Council ofMedical Research (ICMR) 

shows at some places it even takes 900 minutes as a lot of time is wasted in transportation.


Case study


Prem Vati says she immediately called for an ambulance after her pregnant daughter Santoshi sustained injuries to her abdomen.

Two hours later, when the emergency services still hadn't arrived through Delhi's congested roads, the 55-year-old housewife and

her husband Kishori Lal, a snack vendor, decided it would be quicker to take their daughter to hospital in a three-wheeled auto rickshaw

than continue to wait for the ambulance.

Theirs is not a unique experience in a city with more than eight million vehicles, where poor infrastructure and undisciplined drivers 

leave roads gummed up around the clock and the few ambulances that the capital has fight to get through almost unbeatable traffic.

∎ Dr Shakti Gupta, who conducted the research, says that even patients who do get into an ambulance sometimes die on the way to the

hospital because of improper care.

∎ It is surveyed that is wasted  due to jams and social tensions on the way to hospital.

∎ According to WHO the death rate per 100,000 population for road traffic accident has increased from 16.8 in 2009 to 18.9 in 2013.

That’s why it is very necessary to find a solution for the threatening problem.
